# who_are_you

This repository contains a small Python tool for generating an "emotional
portrait" from a set of your favorite artists and works. Provide a JSON file
listing your preferred music artists, movies, painters, pieces of architecture
and books, and the script will analyse them using a simple knowledge base of
descriptive tags.

```
python portrait.py sample_profile.json
```

The included `sample_profile.json` demonstrates the required format.
